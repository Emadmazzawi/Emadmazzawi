🚀 Projects
Highlighted university projects (repos coming soon / check pinned):

4-core CPU Simulator (C): Implemented a cycle-accurate simulator with pipelining, hazards, bus arbitration, and cache coherence.

Simplified DLX CPU (VHDL): Designed a DLX-like processor with full control logic, datapath, and ALU; tested on RESA hardware.

4-bit ALU (VLSI): Built a custom ALU in Cadence with arithmetic, logical, and barrel-shift operations; optimized using Knowles adder.

Fully Differential OTA (Analog ICs): Designed a two-stage fully differential amplifier with CMFB, achieving >60° phase margin and 54 MHz GBW.

Video Processing Pipeline (Python/OpenCV): Developed a 4-stage system (stabilization, background subtraction, matting, tracking) to process and composite videos.
